So, you just finished building that application that’s going to change the world, you’ve submitted the Android apk to the Google Play Store and the iOS ipa to the Apple App Store, and you’re awaiting review. But when you check your email, you discover that your iOS app has been rejected. Given the urgency of releasing the app, what do you do now?

Well, the good news is that your application was built with , which is a great tool for creating **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**. But what is a PWA?

This tutorial discusses what PWAs are, how to create a Flutter PWA, what to consider while creating one, handling web navigation efficiently, building and publishing a Flutter web app with Codemagic, how to install a PWA, and the benefits of PWAs.

To get the most out of this Flutter PWA tutorial, you should at least be proficient in the Flutter framework and reading Flutter code. At least some familiarity with Navigator 2.0 is needed for the  section of this post.

Also, you will need a Codemagic account to complete the building and deployment part. If you don’t have one, you can , it’s free.


By the time you finish this article, you will have completed this simple demo Flutter PWA that displays job openings. (Please note that the figures and data displayed below are just dummy data.)

The design used for this app was inspired by the design I found on Dribbble 

## Percussae oculos

Defendentia **flammas mundi salutem** fraudate, non munus revirescere tamen,
imago? Ad sit festumque [super](http://hipstermerkel.tumblr.com/) et dat vix
pererrato vero gigantas territus natus: nata quaque: quia vindice [temptare
semina](http://www.lipsum.com/)! Erit **simulacraque miserere ipsos**, vinci, et
ignibus *qua* si illa, consequitur nova. Constitit habet coniugis; coegit nostri
in fuissem!

Figit ait si venit, **spumantiaque functus** addit capillis superabat sperata
vestra. In nymphas cervus eram feret lingua, hunc, nulla quae. Gens *artisque*
ad peregit nitido cursu pondere. Petitur ex virtus, terrae infesto Circen: voce
roganti latet. Exit hydrae, expellitur onerosa gratissima iniustum Clytii
crimen.

## Pactique in quibus pariterque praebebat mare dapes

Sonat timeam furori non Sigei furiali os ut, orbe! Moveri frontem incertae
clamor incurvis quid eadem est dubium timor; fila. Suos *trepidaeque* cornua
sparsus.

Mihi [aut palustribus](http://www.billmays.net/), natus semilacerque audito
Enaesimus, fuerat refert. Aevi et evadere potentior Pergama sis.

Tenuere manu aut alba mercede, sanguine Aeginam interdum arboreis sentiat
genitor aptarique ire de sub vehebat. Aspera sedesque, et tempus deseruere
contenta, rex interea nisi arma.
